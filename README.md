## Overview

This project is an intelligent PDF understanding and discussion platform powered by **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. The application allows users to:

**Upload a PDF**
**Ask questions about the content**
**Get AI-generated answers**
**Discuss their doubts with others in a community discussion space**

The AI reads, interprets, and understands the content of the uploaded PDF and enables seamless interaction â€” whether it's clarifying concepts, summarizing sections, or answering specific questions. Additionally, users can interact with each other on a dedicated discussion platform.
